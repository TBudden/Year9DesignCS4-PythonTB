#this file will go through the basics of
#String Manipulation

#Strings are collections of characters
#Strings are enclosed in "" or ''
# "Taylor"
# Two things we need to talk about
# When we think of strings
#index - always starts at 0
#length

#example
#0123
#"Paul"
# Paul length = 4
name = "Taylor"

print(name)

sentence = name + " is cool!" #concalination = adding strings
print(sentence)
print(sentence + "!")
